# VeriHealth - Clinical Remote Monitoring Platform

## Overview

VeriHealth is a cross-platform medical remote monitoring system designed to collect health data from iOS (HealthKit) and Android (Health Connect) devices, sync it to a cloud database in real-time, and provide clinicians with AI-powered risk insights through a comprehensive dashboard. The system supports continuous monitoring of 16+ medical conditions using vitals and behavioral metrics, with automated alerts and notifications.

The current implementation is a **web-based clinician dashboard** built with React, Express, and Supabase. The mobile apps (iOS Swift + HealthKit, Android Kotlin + Health Connect) are planned but not yet implemented in this codebase.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Build System**
- React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- Wouter for lightweight client-side routing (no React Router)
- Problem: Need fast development feedback and optimized production builds
- Solution: Vite provides instant HMR in development and optimized bundling for production
- Trade-offs: Vite requires ESM-compatible packages; some older libraries may need special handling

**UI Component System**
- shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling with custom design tokens
- Problem: Need accessible, customizable UI components without building from scratch
- Solution: Radix UI provides unstyled, accessible primitives; Tailwind enables rapid styling
- Design system: Custom color palette for risk levels (low/medium/high), medical-specific theming

**State Management**
- TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- Problem: Need to handle async data fetching, caching, and real-time updates
- Solution: React Query provides automatic background refetching, cache invalidation, and optimistic updates
- Alternatives considered: Redux (too heavy), Context API (no caching)

**Data Visualization**
- Recharts for vital signs charts and trends
- Custom dashboard components for patient statistics and risk scores

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**
- Express.js with TypeScript in ESM module format
- Problem: Need a lightweight, flexible Node.js server
- Solution: Express provides minimal overhead with extensive middleware ecosystem
- Development vs Production: Vite dev server proxies API requests in dev; static file serving in production

**Database & ORM**
- Supabase (PostgreSQL) for primary data storage
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database queries and migrations
- Problem: Need real-time capabilities, authentication, and relational data modeling
- Solution: Supabase provides managed PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions and auth
- Schema: Users, Patients, Conditions, VitalReadings, RiskScores, Alerts tables

**API Design**
- RESTful API endpoints under `/api` prefix
- Routes handle patient lists, individual patient details, vital readings, and alerts
- Response format: JSON with proper HTTP status codes
- Error handling: Centralized error logging with detailed error responses

**Real-time Updates**
- Polling-based approach (30-second intervals) as fallback
- Designed for Supabase Realtime subscriptions (not yet fully implemented)
- Problem: Clinicians need near real-time patient data updates
- Solution: React Query cache invalidation on intervals; future upgrade to WebSocket-based Supabase Realtime

### Authentication & Authorization

**Planned Authentication**
- Supabase Auth for user management (magic links or OTP)
- Role-based access: patient, clinician, admin
- Current implementation: Mock login (demo credentials) without actual authentication
- Problem: Need secure, healthcare-compliant user authentication
- Solution: Supabase Auth provides HIPAA-eligible authentication when properly configured

### Design Patterns

**Separation of Concerns**
- `client/`: All frontend code (React components, pages, hooks, styles)
- `server/`: Backend API routes and application logic
- `shared/`: Shared types and database schema (Drizzle)
- Problem: Avoid code duplication and maintain consistency between frontend and backend
- Solution: Shared TypeScript definitions ensure type safety across the stack

**Development vs Production**
- Development: `server/index-dev.ts` with Vite middleware for HMR
- Production: `server/index-prod.ts` serves pre-built static assets from `dist/public`
- Build process: `vite build` compiles frontend; `esbuild` bundles backend into single file

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party Services

**Supabase**
- Purpose: Managed PostgreSQL database, authentication, and real-time subscriptions
- Integration: `@supabase/supabase-js` client library
- Environment variables: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- Critical for: All persistent data storage, user authentication, real-time features

**Neon Database (Alternative)**
- Purpose: Serverless PostgreSQL (alternative to Supabase for DB only)
- Integration: `@neondatabase/serverless` for edge-compatible PostgreSQL
- Environment variables: `DATABASE_URL`

**MessageBird (Planned)**
- Purpose: SMS/voice alerts and notifications to clinicians
- Status: Not yet implemented in codebase
- Future use: Send critical alerts when patient risk scores exceed thresholds

### Mobile Platform SDKs (Planned)

**iOS HealthKit**
- Purpose: Collect health data (HR, HRV, BP, SpO2, Sleep, Steps, etc.) from Apple devices
- Status: Not implemented; requires native Swift app
- Architecture: Background delivery, local queue for offline sync, push to Supabase

**Android Health Connect**
- Purpose: Collect same health metrics from Android devices
- Status: Not implemented; requires native Kotlin app
- Architecture: Permission model, background sync, offline-first queue
